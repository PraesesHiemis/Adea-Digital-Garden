## The Gods
For now assume that most gods that are present in the Forgotten Realms are present in this world as well. More info about the gods will come later.


## Eidolons
An Eidolon is a worldly force that relates to an ideal or way of thought. They are not gods but some are worshiped as such. While they have lore and iconography tied to them, knowledge about the Eidolons is quite scarce, making them quite mysterious to the common man.  
  
The most common theory is that the Eidolons were once people who in some way or another died when the gods remade Adea. It is believed that each of them had strong convictions that led them to embody those aspects of their personality. Many believe this was made possible because of the abundance of raw magic in the world at that time.
  
The nature of the Eidolons make them poor options for a cleric’s worship in comparison to the gods. With that said there are clerics that devote themselves to an Eidolon and draw upon them to fuel magic of their own. Paladins generally have an easier time devoting themselves to an Eidolon since they primarily draw power from their sacred oath. Some Warlocks also draw upon the Eidolons for their magical abilities, but this most often stolen rather than granted.  
  
Sometimes the Eidolons have been known to interact with certain individuals. The way this happens depends on the specific Eidolon and its personality. Some claim to have heard whispers out of nowhere, others say they saw spirits leading them toward their goal. Some simply felt the sudden urge to take a left turn and happened upon some beneficial situation or other. These are rare occurrences  

### Duality
The Eidolon called Duality is the world force that ensures there are always two sides to all things. An act that harms one person is often beneficial to another and vice versa. Duality is entirely neutral and unbiased, it takes no sides. The Eidolon itself influences luck and chance so that no one individual is exceptionally lucky or unlucky throughout their lives. 

*Iconography*: A featureless face with glowing eyes. The right side of the face is wreathed in flames and the left is frozen over with ice.  

## Fortune
Many adventurers, pirates and treasure seekers look to Fortune to guide them to riches. Fortune is more often worshiped and prayed to than most other Eidolons. It seems to be fairly neutral, striving to steer people towards adventure and riches, regardless of that person's moral standings.

  
*Iconography*: A dagger piercing a gold coin.
