#### Additional Information:  
The birthing process of Sylvari is quite peculiar. They lack reproductive organs and have no alternative way to reproduce. Occasionally a flower with a particularly thick stalk sprouts in the forest clearing they have claimed as their home, a place they call “The Grove”. The flower rapidly grows in size, forming a bulbous cocoon. It grows to a height of about 120-150 centimeters roughly over the course of 6-7 months. Inside one such cocoon a single sylvari grows over that time period.  

So far a number of these flowers have been known to sprout in the grove each spring. They grow throughout the summer and birth new sylvari into the world in the autumn. As such the autumn is seen as a happy and welcoming time in the grove. To this day around 170 sylvari have been born.

These flowers and subsequent cocoons are carefully tended by the first generation of sylvari. Partially to ensure nothing happens to them but also to be there and welcome newly born sylvari and help them orient themselves.

#### Nourishment:

The biology of a sylvari differs massively from humanoids. One such difference is that sylvari don’t have the same needs for food as humanoids. On a calm day when they don’t exert much energy they can sustain themselves entirely using photosynthesis. Though they still need to consume water. The average adventuring day is taxing however, on strenuous days they need to eat food like any other species.  
  
Equally interesting is that they don’t necessarily need to drink water to consume it. Merely standing in a pond is enough to absorb water through other parts of their bodies.
