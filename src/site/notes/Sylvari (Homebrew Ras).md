Additional Information:  
The birthing process of Sylvari is quite peculiar. They lack reproductive organs and have no alternative way to reproduce. Occasionally a flower with a particularly thick stalk sprouts in the forest clearing they have claimed as their home, a place they call “The Grove”. The flower rapidly grows in size, forming a bulbous cocoon. It grows to a height of about 120-150 centimeters roughly over the course of 6-7 months. Inside one such cocoon a single sylvari grows over that time period.  

So far a number of these flowers have been known to sprout in the grove each spring. They grow throughout the summer and birth new sylvari into the world in the autumn. As such the autumn is seen as a happy and welcoming time in the grove. To this day around 170 sylvari have been born.
