## Eidolons
A spirit is a worldly force that relates to an ideal or way of thought. They are not gods but some are worshiped as such. While they have lore and iconography tied to them, knowledge about the Eidolons is quite scarce, making them quite mysterious to the common man.  
  
The most common theory is that the Eidolons were once people who in some way or another died when the gods remade Adea. It is believed that each of them had strong convictions that led them to embody those aspects of their personality. 

The nature of the Eidolons make them poor options for a cleric’s worship in comparison to the god. With that said there are clerics that devote themselves to an Eidolon and draw upon their existence to fuel magic of their own. Paladins generally have an easier time devoting themselves to an Eidolon since they draw power from their sacred oath primarily. Some Warlocks also draw upon the Eidolons for their magical abilities, but this magic is often not granted.  
  
Sometimes the Eidolons have been known to interact with certain individuals. The way this happens depends on the specific Eidolon and its personality. Some claim to have heard whispers out of nowhere, others say they saw spirits leading them toward their goal. Some simply felt the sudden urge to take a left turn and happened upon some beneficial situation or other.

Most of their names have been lost to time and so people started naming them based on what they represent in the world. Those are the names that we use today.

#### Duality  
The Eidolon called Duality is the world force that ensures there are always two sides to all things. An act that harms one person is often beneficial to another and vice versa. Duality is entirely neutral and unbiased, it takes no sides. The Eidolon itself influences luck and chance so that no one individual is exceptionally lucky or unlucky throughout their lives. 

*Iconography*: A featureless face with glowing eyes. The right side of the face is wreathed in flames and the left is frozen over with ice.  

#### Fortune
Many adventurers, pirates and treasure seekers look to Fortune to guide them to riches. It might show itself to the captain of a ship as a glimmer on a nearby beach. Indicating that there may be something valuable on an otherwise normal island. Fortune is more often worshiped and prayed to than most other Eidolons 

*Iconography*: A dagger piercing a gold coin.

#### Guile
Guile is, as far as we know, the Eidolon with the strongest sense of personality. It favors those who are cunning and conniving. People who are willing to step over anyone to get to their goal, no matter how selfish it may be. 

*Iconography*:

#### Lumina
A spirit of light and warmth. Sometimes it appears to people who are lost in the dark, guiding them out into safety. There are tales of people seeing a mote of light that guided 

*Iconography*: A lit candle surrounded by darkness.

#### Hymn

You might have heard the whistling of the wind sound or waves crashing in a rhythmic beat. That is more often than not the influence of Hymn. It often reveals itself to bards, inspiring them to create or harmonize.  
  
*Iconography*: A musical note forming the outline of a lute.

#### Mania

Mania is an Eidolon often associated with evil. It has been said to toy with people or drive them insane. Sometimes it manifests as strange sounds or visions you can’t quite understand. Slowly agonizing you until you don’t know if the things you see are true or false. It is believed that the person that became Mania went insane during  

*Iconography*: Simple line art of a pair of eyes, glaring at you.

#### Zephyr  
A spirit of wind and movement. Sometimes it might change the wind in your favor, directing it straight into your sails. It encourages going with the flow and seeing where you end up. Some monks adopt this ideology for their martial arts, developing particularly fluent movements.  
  
*Iconography*: A leaf falling from a branch.
