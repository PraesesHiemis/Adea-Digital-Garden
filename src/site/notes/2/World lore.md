## In the Beginning

Various religious teachings speak of what it was like at the beginning of the world, though there are many variations of the story. Most however would agree that the gods and devils were among the first to set their feet on the planet. It is highly likely that a few Archfey as well as some particularly old Elementals, called Primordials, inhabited the world at the same time, if not slightly after.

The gods and devils generally didn’t get along. Though there were some exceptions. Sometimes there were small feuds or battles, often there were disagreements about how to treat Adea and its other inhabitants. 

The Archfey were a bit more nomadic. Old texts say that they generally were among the more social inhabitants of Adea. They would travel the world, visiting all who would welcome them. They would visit those who didn’t appreciate their presence either, usually with mischievous intent. In fact most of them were mischievous. Though they weren't strangers to the occasional good deed.  
  
The Primordials were quite territorial, mostly out of instincts. They were in most cases not as intelligent or self aware as the other beings. Nor did they seem to have especially strong personalities, if any at all. They mostly stuck to areas where their presence could not be mistaken for anything else. Mountains were raised, rivers were made and volcanoes erupted. While all of these could be created naturally some of them were the direct product of the natural forces of the Primordials.

All of these beings inhabited Adea. They did so mostly secluded from one another.  
Some got along, others didn’t. After some time a conflict was unavoidable. It would claim the lives of many mortals and even some gods.

## The Fracture

Many battles took place on Adea over the course of several months. This was a time of fighting, deceit and switching sides. Some gods joined the side of the devils and fought alongside their former enemies. Some battles were small in scale, others lasted days or even weeks. Some duels between gods could last days by themselves and their fighting could be felt on entirely separate continents. Most of these battles were fought over ideologies, how their presence in the world should work. Others were fought simply because some individuals craved battle.

During the most intense of these battles the planet cracked and split into several parts. This event has been named “The Fracture” because of this. Continents moved, cities toppled, large mountains and craters were created. Some small parts of the planet drifted closer to the sun and became scorched deserts.

All the beings that fought saw the destruction they caused. They might not have cared about each other's fates but they all had interests on Adea that they wanted to preserve. Their collective interests turned into a temporary alliance as they all collaborated with putting the world together again. And while they did so successfully there was damage done to parts of the planet that can be seen even today. 

This is also when the other planes of existence were created. The collaboration between these beings was short lived though. So they all decided to leave Adea and make separate worlds for themselves to inhabit. The devils made the 9 hells, the gods created Elysium, the fey returned to the Feywild which already existed before the Fracture. Alongside these new realms more were created, namely the Elemental planes and the Astral Sea. This would ensure that they would not clash again. If they did however, it would be far away from the mortal world. All the fighting led up to a stalemate in the end. These events became the basis for the primary year count across most of the world. That being Post Fracture (PF).
  
The Eidolons, that were created during the fracture, were mortals before their passing. And so they were permitted to stay in the material plane as spirits. Each overseeing a small domain of their own.
